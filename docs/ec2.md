Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a core AWS service that provides scalable, on-demand virtual servers in the cloud. EC2 lets you launch, manage, and scale instances for various workloads, with flexible pricing options and integrations with other AWS services. Key features include:

- On-demand, scalable virtual servers (instances)
- Multiple instance types and AMIs
- Secure access with key pairs and security groups
- Persistent and temporary storage options
- Integration with services like Auto Scaling, CloudWatch, and Elastic Load Balancing

You can manage EC2 via the AWS Console, CLI, SDKs, or APIs. Pricing includes Free Tier, On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot Instances. EC2 is suitable for web hosting, applications, and compute-intensive tasks.

## Types of EC2

For details on EC2 instance types, see the [Types of EC2](types of ec2.md) document.
